Chapter 36


If Elizabeth when Mr gave her the letter did not it
of offers had formed no expectation of
contents such as they were it may how eagerly
went them and contrariety of emotion they
Her feelings as read were defined With amazement did
first understand that believed any apology in
and was that no
give just sense of shame would not conceal With
against everything say of
had read with an hardly
left her of comprehension and of the
sentence was incapable of the sense of

her was not penitent It was pride and
insolence

when subject was succeeded of Mr when
read with somewhat clearer of events
if true must overthrow every cherished of worth and
bore so alarming an affinity of her
feelings were yet and of definition
apprehension and even horror oppressed her
discredit it entirely exclaiming must
cannot must the grossest and when had
gone the letter though anything of the

regard it that would never look in it again

In perturbed state of mind with thoughts that on
on it would not do in half minute the letter
was again and collecting as as
again the of that and
commanded so as the of every sentence
The of with the Pemberley was

So each recital confirmed the when came the

impossible not that there was gross on side or the

not err when read and re read with the closest the
of s resigning pretensions
the living of receiving in lieu so sum as three
thousand pounds again was forced down
the letter weighed every with
impartiality deliberated on the of each with
little On sides it was only Again read
on every proved that the affair had
believed it impossible that any so as
render Mr s conduct in it than was capable of
turn must make entirely blameless the

The and profligacy scrupled not lay
Mr s charge shocked her the so as
no of had never heard of before

no such befriended her instantly before

good than the approbation of the neighbourhood and
the regard social had in the mess After
pausing on

referred for the of every particular

near concern in s and whose character had no

banished the that Mr would never
hazarded such proposal if had not been assured of

remembered everything that had in
between and in their first Mr Phillips s
Many of were still fresh in her memory was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications stranger and
it had her before saw the of
as had and the of professions
with conduct remembered that had boasted of no fear
of Mr that Mr leave the country that
ground yet had avoided the ball
the week remembered that till the
had the country had told story no
that after their it had been discussed
that had then no no in sinking Mr s
character though had assured her that for the father would
always prevent exposing the son

How differently did everything now appear in was
were now the of views solely and
hatefully and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of grasp anything
now had no tolerable had
either been deceived with regard her fortune or had been
vanity encouraging the preference believed had
incautiously Every lingering struggle in favour fainter
and fainter and in farther justification of Mr not
that Mr Bingley when Jane had ago
asserted blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as
were had never in the of their
an had latterly brought them much
together and given her of intimacy with ways seen anything
that unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke
of irreligious or immoral that among was
esteemed and valued that even had allowed as
brother and that had heard speak so of
as prove capable of feeling that had
actions been Mr represented them so gross violation of
everything right hardly been the world and
that between capable of it and such an man
as Mr Bingley was incomprehensible

How despicably prided myself
on my discernment valued myself on my

my vanity in or blameable mistrust How is
discovery Yet how just humiliation Had been in
not been wretchedly blind vanity not has been my
folly with the preference of and offended the neglect
of the on the of courted
prepossession and and driven away where either were
Till never knew myself

Jane Jane Bingley her thoughts were in
brought her that Mr s
there had appeared and read it again Widely
different was the of second How that
credit assertions in had been obliged
give in the declared totally unsuspicious of her
s and not remembering s
had always been the of
description of Jane felt that Jane s feelings though fervent were
little displayed and that there was in her air
and manner not with sensibility

When came that of the letter in her were
in terms of such yet merited her sense
of shame was severe The of the charge struck her forcibly
for and the circumstances as
the ball and as confirming first
not impression on mind
than on hers

The and her was not unfelt It soothed
it not her for the had been
attracted the of her and as considered
that Jane s disappointment had in been the work of her
and how the credit of must hurt
such impropriety of conduct felt depressed anything
had ever before

After wandering along the for way every
of re considering events probabilities
and reconciling as as change so sudden and
so important and of her
her and entered the with the wish
of appearing as and the of repressing such
as must make her unfit for

was told that the gentlemen had each
called her Mr only for take
leave that had been sitting with them
an hoping for her and after her
till Elizabeth just affect concern
in missing rejoiced it was no
longer an object think only of her letter



Chapter 37


The gentlemen left the morning and Mr
been in near the make them parting obeisance was
the of their appearing in
good and in as tolerable as expected after the
so gone then
hastened Lady and her daughter and on
brought with satisfaction message her
importing that felt so dull as make her desirous of

Elizabeth not Lady without that had
it time been presented her as

Their first subject was the diminution of the

You must contrive somebody the greatest in
the world that of thing women always
guarded and attended according their situation in life When my

Lady had many respecting their journey
and as did not answer them was
Elizabeth believed for her or with mind so
occupied where was must
for solitary whenever was alone gave way it
as the greatest relief and not went without solitary
in indulge in the delight of unpleasant
recollections

Mr s letter was in fair way of
studied every sentence and her feelings were
times widely different When remembered the of address
was still of when considered how unjustly
had condemned and upbraided her anger was turned against
and disappointed feelings the object of compassion
gratitude character
not nor for repent her
or the slightest ever again In her
there was of vexation and regret and in
the of her subject of yet heavier chagrin
They were hopeless of remedy Her father contented with
them would never exert restrain the giddiness of
and her mother with so right
was entirely of the evil Elizabeth had
with Jane in an check the of
and they were supported their mother s
there of improvement weak spirited
irritable and under s had been always
affronted their and willed and careless would
give them hearing They were ignorant idle and vain
there was an officer in they would flirt with and
was of Longbourn they would going there
forever

Anxiety on Jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and Mr s
restoring Bingley her former good
heightened the sense of Jane had affection was proved
been sincere and conduct cleared of blame any
the implicitness of in friend How
then was the that of situation so desirable in every
so replete with advantage so for Jane had
been the folly and indecorum of her

When these recollections was the development of s
character it may believed that the happy had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as make it
impossible for her appear tolerably

Their were as frequent the week of
her as they had been first The was
there and her again into the of
their journey gave them as the best method of packing
and was so urgent on the of gowns in the only right
way that obliged on her the
work of the morning and her trunk afresh

When they parted Lady with condescension them
good journey and them come Hunsford again year
and de Bourgh exerted so as curtsey and hold her
hand



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr met for breakfast
before the appeared and took the opportunity of
the parting civilities deemed indispensably

not Elizabeth said Mrs has yet
her sense of your in am
certain you not leave the without receiving her thanks for
it The favour of your has been much felt you We
how little there is anyone humble
manner of living and domestics and the little we
of the world must make Hunsford dull lady

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and of
had weeks with enjoyment and the of being with

the obliged Mr was gratified and with
solemnity

It gives me hear that you your time not
disagreeably We certainly best and fortunately
it in introduce you and
with the frequent means of the
humble think we may flatter that your Hunsford
visit cannot been entirely situation with regard
Lady s is indeed the of advantage
and blessing can You on footing we You
how continually we there In must acknowledge
that with the disadvantages of humble
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion they
sharers of intimacy

were for the elevation of feelings and was
obliged the room Elizabeth
and in sentences

You may in carry report of into
Hertfordshire my dear flatter myself that you
do so Lady s Mrs you

that your friend has drawn an unfortunate on it
as silent Only me you my dear Elizabeth
that can my cordially wish you in
My dear and mind and way of
thinking There is in everything remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between We seem been designed for each


Elizabeth say that it was where that was
the and with sincerity add that firmly believed
and rejoiced in was not sorry however
the recital of them the lady they sprang
Poor it was leave her such
had it with her eyes open and though regretting that
her visitors were did not seem for compassion Her
and her her and her and their
had not yet their

the arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels
and it was pronounced After an
parting between the Elizabeth was attended the carriage
Mr and as they down the was commissioning her
with best her not forgetting thanks
for the had received Longbourn in the winter and
Mr and Mrs Gardiner though then handed her
in and the was on the of being
when reminded them with consternation that they had
leave any message for the ladies

you of wish your humble
them with your grateful thanks for their you

Elizabeth no objection the was then allowed and
the carriage drove

Good gracious after it seems
or we first came and yet how many things


many indeed said her companion with sigh

We dined times besides drinking there twice
How much tell

Elizabeth privately And how much conceal

Their journey was without much or any and
four of their Hunsford they Mr Gardiner s
where they were days

Jane and Elizabeth had little opportunity of her
amidst the the of her
aunt had for them Jane was with her and
Longbourn there would leisure enough for observation

It was not without an effort that wait even for
Longbourn before told her of Mr s proposals
that had the of revealing would so
Jane and must the same time so highly of her
vanity had not yet been away was such temptation
as conquered the state of indecision
in remained as the extent of communicate
and her fear if entered on the subject of being hurried
into of Bingley only grieve her




Chapter 39


It was the second week in May in the three ladies
together Street for the of in Hertfordshire
and as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr Bennet s carriage
was them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s
punctuality and looking of dining room
These girls had been above an in the place happily
in an opposite milliner the sentinel on and
salad and cucumber

After welcoming their they displayed
with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming

three straws her such nasty little freckled
thing

Elizabeth was shocked think that however incapable of such
coarseness of expression the coarseness of the
was little than her had harboured and fancied liberal

As as had ate and the paid the carriage was
and after the with their
boxes work bags and parcels and the unwelcome of s and
s purchases were seated in it

How nicely we crammed in am bought my

And in the first place hear has you

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did

companions the way Longbourn Elizabeth listened as little as
there was no escaping the frequent of s name

Their reception was Mrs Bennet rejoiced Jane
in undiminished beauty and than dinner did Mr Bennet
say voluntarily Elizabeth

Their in the dining room was for the

occupied them Lady Lucas was inquiring of after the welfare and
of her eldest daughter Mrs Bennet was doubly on

Oh Mary said wish you had gone with for we had such
As we went along and drew the blinds and pretended there

generality of minds they would no for

anybody for than half minute and never attended Mary

In the afternoon was urgent with the of the girls

frequent discussion between her Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the of yielding answers were
the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though
disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding



Chapter 40


Elizabeth s acquaint Jane with had
no longer overcome and suppress every
particular in her was and her
her the morning the of the
between Mr and

Bennet s was lessened the sisterly
partiality any of Elizabeth appear
natural and surprise was shortly in feelings was
sorry that Mr in manner so
little suited recommend them still was grieved for the
unhappiness her s must given

being so sure of succeeding was wrong said and certainly
not appeared consider how much it must increase
disappointment

Indeed Elizabeth am sorry for has
feelings drive away regard for me
You do not blame me however for refusing

Blame you Oh no

you blame me for spoken so of

No do not that you were wrong in saying you did

you it when tell you the


then spoke of the letter the of contents as
as they George stroke was for poor Jane
would willingly gone the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the race of mankind as was here
collected in Nor was s vindication though
grateful her feelings capable of her for such discovery
did labour prove the of and
seek the without involving the

not do said Elizabeth you never make
of them good for anything Take your choice you must satisfied
with only There is such quantity of between them just
enough make good of man and of it has been shifting
much For my am it s
you do as you

It was time however before extorted Jane

do not when been shocked said so
bad It is And poor Mr Dear Lizzy only
consider must suffered Such disappointment and with the
of your ill and such thing
of It is am sure you must it
so

Oh no my regret and compassion away you so
of you do such that am
every unconcerned and indifferent Your profusion
me saving and if you over much longer my
as as feather

Poor there is such an expression of in
countenance such an and gentleness in manner

There certainly was mismanagement in the of those
men has the and the the
of it

never Mr so in the of it as you
do

And yet in taking so decided
without any It is such spur s such an
opening for of that may continually
abusive without saying anything just cannot always
man without now and then stumbling on witty

Lizzy when you first read that letter am sure you not
the matter as you do now

Indeed not was enough may say And
with no speak felt no Jane me and say
that had not been so weak and vain and nonsensical as knew
had Oh how wanted you

How unfortunate that you such
in speaking of Mr for now they do appear
undeserved

Certainly the misfortune of speaking with is
natural of the prejudices had been encouraging There
is on want your want told
or not make acquaintances in understand
s character

Bennet paused little and then there can no
occasion for exposing so dreadfully is your

That it not attempted Mr has not me
make communication public On the every particular
relative was kept as much as possible
myself and if undeceive people as the of
conduct me The against Mr
is so violent that it would the of half the good people in
attempt place in an am not
it gone and therefore it not signify
anyone here is time hence it
and then we may laugh their stupidity in not it before
say it

You quite right errors public for
ever is now sorry for has and
re character We must not make desperate

The of Elizabeth s mind was allayed had
of of the secrets had weighed on her for fortnight
and was certain of in Jane whenever wish
talk again of either there was still lurking
of forbade the disclosure not the
half of Mr s letter nor explain her how sincerely
had been valued her friend Here was in no
partake and was sensible that than
understanding between the parties justify her in
encumbrance of mystery And then said if that
ever take place merely
tell Bingley may tell in much manner The
liberty of communication cannot mine till it has

was now on being settled leisure observe the real
state of her s Jane was not happy still cherished
affection for Bingley never even fancied
in before her regard had the warmth of first
and her and steadiness than first
attachments and so fervently did remembrance
and prefer every man that her good sense and her
the feelings of her were requisite check the
of those regrets must been injurious her
and their tranquillity

Lizzy said Mrs Bennet is your now of
sad business of Jane s For my am never speak
of it again anybody told my Phillips so the
cannot that Jane saw anything of in London is
undeserving man and do not suppose there s the
in the world of her ever now There is no talk of
again in the summer and of
everybody is likely

do not ever live any

Oh it is just as chooses Nobody come Though
always say my daughter ill and if was her
would not with it my is am sure Jane
die of and then sorry for has

as Elizabeth not any such expectation
no answer

Lizzy her mother afterwards and so the
Collinses live do they only hope
it And of do they is an
excellent manager dare say If is half as sharp as her
mother is saving enough There is extravagant in their
dare say

No

deal of good management depend it Yes yes they
take care not outrun their They never distressed
for much good may it do them And so suppose they
talk of Longbourn when your father is dead They look it as
quite their dare say whenever that

It was subject they not before me

No it would been if they had make no they
talk of it between if they can easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their so much the better
of that was only on me



Chapter 41


The first week of their was gone The second It was
the of the s in and the ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace The dejection was
The Bennets alone were still eat drink
and sleep and pursue the of their employments
were they for and
whose was extreme and not comprehend such
heartedness in any of the

Good is of we do would they
exclaim in the of woe How can you so
Lizzy

Their mother their grief remembered
had endured on occasion and years
ago

am sure said for days together when
Miller s went away my

am sure break mine said

If Brighton Mrs Bennet

Oh yes if Brighton papa is so
disagreeable

little sea bathing would me forever

And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me deal of good


Such were the of lamentations resounding
Longbourn Elizabeth diverted them sense
of was in shame felt anew the of Mr s
and never had been so much disposed pardon
interference in the views of friend

the gloom of s prospect was shortly cleared away for
received an Mrs the of the of
the her Brighton invaluable friend was
and resemblance in good humour
and good had recommended her and each and of
their three months they had been intimate

The rapture of on occasion her adoration of Mrs

congratulations and and talking with violence than ever
the luckless in the repined her fate
in terms as as her accent was peevish

cannot Mrs not me as as
said Though am not her particular friend just as much
right asked as has and for am years

In vain did Elizabeth attempt make her reasonable and Jane make
her resigned As for Elizabeth was so
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and that
considered it as the warrant of possibility of sense
for the latter and detestable as such must make her were it
not advising her father not her

such as Mrs and the of her being yet
imprudent with such companion Brighton where the temptations must

never easy until has exposed in public
place or and we can never her do it with so
little expense or her as under the
circumstances

If you were aware said Elizabeth of the disadvantage
must the public notice of s and
imprudent manner has already arisen it am sure you
would judge differently in the affair

Already arisen Mr Bennet has frightened away
of your Poor little Lizzy do not cast down Such
squeamish youths as cannot with little absurdity

Indeed you no such injuries It is not

father not take the trouble of checking her exuberant and
of teaching her that her pursuits not the business of

Had Elizabeth s been drawn her

of good humour and beauty generally give had
whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had early in
their an end real affection for her
and had vanished for ever and views

the country and of and these tastes had arisen
enjoyments was little otherwise than as
her and folly had contributed is not
the of man would in wish
where of wanting the true
philosopher derive benefit such as given

Elizabeth however had never been blind the impropriety of her
father s as husband had always seen it with pain
respecting and grateful for of
endeavoured not overlook and
her thoughts that continual of conjugal obligation
and in exposing the of her
was so highly had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages must the of so
unsuitable nor ever been so aware of the
so ill judged direction of talents talents rightly
the respectability of even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over s little
cause for satisfaction in the of the Their parties
abroad were varied than before and had mother and
whose repinings the dullness of everything around
them threw real gloom over their and though
in time regain her natural of sense the disturbers
of her brain were removed her whose
evil apprehended was likely hardened in
her folly and assurance situation of such as
watering place and camp the therefore
has been before that an had been
looking with desire did not in taking place the
satisfaction had promised It was consequently
name period for the commencement of
on her and and
again the of anticipation for the
and for another disappointment Her tour the
was now the object of her thoughts it was her best
for the the discontentedness of her mother
and inevitable and included Jane in the
every of it would been

it is that wish for
Were the complete my disappointment would certain
here carrying with me ceaseless of regret in my
s may reasonably hope my expectations of
realised of every promises delight can
never successful and disappointment is only warded
the defence of little peculiar vexation

When went away promised and
her mother and her were always expected and
always Those her mother contained little than that
they were just the where such and such
had attended them and where had seen such as
her quite that had new gown or new parasol
would was obliged leave in
violent as Mrs called her and they were going
the camp and her correspondence with her there was still
for her though longer were
much of under the public

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her good
humour and cheerfulness reappear Longbourn Everything wore
happier aspect The families had been in for the winter came
again and summer and summer Mrs Bennet
was restored her querulous and the middle of
was so much as enter without
tears an of such happy as make Elizabeth hope that
the Christmas so tolerably reasonable as not
an officer above and
the War Office another quartered in


The time for the of their tour was now
and fortnight only was wanting of it when letter
arrived Mrs Gardiner delayed commencement and
curtailed extent Mr Gardiner would prevented business
setting till fortnight later in July and must in London again
and as that left period for them so
and so much as they had proposed or it with
the leisure and they had on they were obliged give
the and substitute contracted tour and according the
were no farther northwards than Derbyshire In that
county there was enough seen the of their three
weeks and Mrs Gardiner it had attraction The
where had formerly years of her life and where
they were now spend days was as an object of
her curiosity as the celebrated of Matlock Chatsworth
Dovedale or the Peak

Elizabeth was disappointed had her on
the and still there been time enough it
was her business satisfied and certainly her temper happy
and was right again

With the of Derbyshire there were many ideas It was
impossible for her the word without thinking of Pemberley and
said may enter county with impunity
and rob it of petrified spars without me

The period of expectation was now doubled Four weeks were away
before her uncle and aunt s arrival they did away and Mr
and Mrs Gardiner with their four did appear
Longbourn The girls of and eight years old and
younger were left under the particular care of their
Jane was the and whose steady sense and
of temper adapted her for them in every
way teaching them with them and loving them

The only night Longbourn and the
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of and
enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions
suitableness comprehended and temper
cheerfulness enhance every and affection
and it among if there were
disappointments abroad

It is not the object of work give description of Derbyshire
nor of any of the remarkable their route thither

of Derbyshire is the
concern the little of Lambton the of Mrs Gardiner s
former residence and where had
still remained they their steps after seen the
of the country and miles of Lambton
Elizabeth her aunt that Pemberley was situated It was not
in their direct road nor than mile or of it In
talking over their route the before Mrs Gardiner
an the place again Mr Gardiner declared
willingness and Elizabeth was applied for her approbation

My not you place of you heard
so much said her aunt place with so many of your
acquaintances there you


Elizabeth was distressed felt that had no business
Pemberley and was obliged assume disinclination for it
must that was tired of after going over so
many had no in carpets or satin curtains

Mrs Gardiner abused her stupidity If it were merely
richly furnished said not care it myself
the They of the finest woods in the
country

Elizabeth said no her mind not acquiesce The
possibility of Mr the place instantly
It would blushed the and
it would better speak her aunt than such
against there were and finally
that it the resource if her the

Accordingly when night asked the chambermaid

Elizabeth s mind was for saw and admired

On applying the place they were into the

Mr and Mrs Gardiner Elizabeth not saying It is
much credit am sure that you think so

the Elizabeth was going and
listened with increasing as the
never word in my life and ever
was four years old

ideas That was not good man had been her
Her was longed hear and was
grateful her uncle for saying

There people of so much can said You in
such master

Yes am If were the world
not with better always that they
good natured when good natured when they grow and
was always the sweetest hearted boy in the
world

Elizabeth stared her Can Mr

Yes am that was indeed and son just just
as affable the poor

Elizabeth listened and was for Mrs
Reynolds interest her on no the subjects
of the pictures the dimensions of the and the price of the
furniture in vain Mr Gardiner highly the of
her of her
master again the subject and dwelt with energy on
many merits as they proceeded together the staircase

is the best landlord and the best master said that ever
not the men nowadays think of
There is not of or give
good name people call proud am sure never saw
anything of it my it is only not rattle away
men

In an place Elizabeth

of whispered her aunt as they is not
quite consistent with poor friend

we deceived

That is not likely was good

On reaching the spacious lobby above they were into
sitting room with and lightness than
the apartments and were informed that it was just
give had the room when
Pemberley

is certainly good brother said Elizabeth as
of the

Mrs Reynolds s delight when enter
the room And is always the way with
can give any is sure in There
is would not do for her

The picture and or three of the bedrooms were
that remained In the former were many good paintings
Elizabeth knew of the and such as had been already
had willingly turned look drawings of
s in crayons whose subjects were usually interesting and
intelligible

In the there were many portraits they
little fix the of stranger Elizabeth in of
the only whose features would her it arrested
her and striking resemblance Mr with such
over the as remembered seen when
her several before the picture in earnest
contemplation and it again before they the
Mrs Reynolds informed them that it had been in father s
lifetime

There was certainly in Elizabeth s mind
sensation the than had ever felt the height of
their The bestowed on Mrs Reynolds
was of no nature is valuable than the
of an servant As brother landlord master
considered how many people s were in guardianship how
much of or pain was it in bestow how much of
good or evil must Every that had been brought
the was character and as
before the canvas on was represented and
eyes of regard with deeper of
gratitude than it had ever before remembered warmth and
softened impropriety of expression

When of the that was open inspection had been seen
they and taking leave of the were
consigned over the gardener met them the hall

As they across the hall the river Elizabeth turned
look again her uncle and aunt and the former
was as the date of the the of it
came the road it the stables

They were yards of each and so abrupt was
that it was impossible sight Their eyes
instantly met and the of were overspread with the deepest
and for
surprise shortly recovering advanced the
and spoke Elizabeth if not in terms of
of

had turned away stopping on approach
received with an impossible
overcome Had first or resemblance the picture
they had just been been the
that they now saw Mr the gardener s expression of surprise on
beholding master must told it They little
aloof was talking their astonished and confused
lift her eyes and knew not answer
civil after her Amazed the
of manner they parted every sentence that
uttered was increasing her and every of the
impropriety of her being there recurring her mind the
in they were of the in
her life Nor did seem much ease when spoke accent
had none of sedateness and as
the time of her left Longbourn and of her in
Derbyshire so and in so hurried way as spoke the
distraction of thoughts

every fail and after
without saying word and took
leave

The then her and of figure
Elizabeth heard not word and her feelings
them in was shame and vexation Her
there was the unfortunate the ill judged thing in the
world How it must appear In disgraceful
it not strike so vain man It seem as if had purposely
in way again Oh did come Or did
come before was expected Had they been only
sooner they been the of discrimination
for it was that was that arrived that alighted
horse or carriage blushed again and again over
the of the And so strikingly
altered it mean That even speak her was
amazing speak with such inquire after her
Never in her life had seen so little dignified never
had spoken with such gentleness as on
did it offer address in when
letter into her hand knew not think or how
for it

They had now entered the side of the water and
every was bringing nobler fall of ground or
of the woods they were it was time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though answered
mechanically the appeals of her uncle and aunt and
direct her eyes such objects as they pointed
no of the Her thoughts were on that
spot of Pemberley whichever it where Mr then
was longed the was in mind in
manner of her and in defiance of everything
was still dear had been civil only
felt ease yet there had been that in voice was
not ease had felt of pain or of in
her not tell certainly had not seen her with


however the remarks of her companions on her of mind
aroused her and felt the of appearing

They entered the woods and the river for
of the when in spots where the opening of
the gave the wander were many views of the
valley the opposite hills with the of woods overspreading
many and of the stream Mr Gardiner wish
of going round the it
With triumphant they were told that it was miles round
It settled the matter and they the accustomed circuit
brought them again after time in descent among hanging woods
the of the water and of narrowest They
it simple bridge in character with the air of the
it was spot than any they had yet and the
valley here contracted into glen allowed room only for the stream
and amidst the rough coppice wood bordered it
Elizabeth longed explore windings when they had the
bridge and perceived their distance the Mrs Gardiner
was not no farther and only
of the carriage as quickly as possible Her was
therefore obliged submit and they took their way the
on the opposite side of the river in the direction their
was slow for Mr Gardiner though seldom indulge the
taste was of fishing and was so much in the
of trout in the water and talking the
man them that advanced little wandering on in
slow manner they were again and Elizabeth s
was quite it had been first the sight of Mr
them and no distance The being here
sheltered than on the side allowed them before
they met Elizabeth however astonished was
for an interview than before and appear and speak with
if intended them For indeed
felt that would strike into path The
lasted turning in the their the
turning was before them With glance saw
that had none of recent and imitate
politeness as they met the beauty of the place
had not the and when
recollections obtruded and fancied that of
Pemberley her mischievously construed Her changed
and said no

Mrs Gardiner was little and on her pausing asked
her if would do the honour of introducing her
was stroke of for was quite unprepared
and hardly suppress being now the
of of those people against pride had
revolted in offer surprise
when they them now for people of
fashion

The however was and as named their
stole sly look how bore
it and was not without the expectation of decamping as as
such disgraceful companions That was the
was sustained it however with fortitude and
so going away turned with them and entered into
with Mr Gardiner Elizabeth not
not triumph It was that had
for there was no listened
that between them and gloried in every
expression every sentence of her uncle marked
taste or good

The turned fishing and heard Mr
with the greatest there as as
chose in the neighbourhood offering the same time
with fishing tackle and those of
the stream where there was usually sport Mrs Gardiner was
walking in with Elizabeth gave her look expressive of wonder
Elizabeth said it gratified her the
must for Her however was extreme and
continually was is so altered can
it proceed It cannot for me it cannot for my sake that
softened My reproofs Hunsford not work such
change as It is impossible that still me

After walking time in way the ladies in the
gentlemen on resuming their after descending
the brink of the river for the better inspection of
water plant there chanced little It originated
in Mrs Gardiner fatigued the of the morning
Elizabeth s inadequate her support and consequently
her husband s Mr took her place her and they on
together After the lady first spoke
that had been assured of before came the
place and accordingly that arrival had been
for your informed that
you would certainly not here till and indeed before we
left Bakewell we that you were not expected
in the country acknowledged the of it and said that
business with steward had occasioned
before the of the with had been They
join me early and among them
an with you Mr Bingley and

Elizabeth answered only bow Her thoughts were instantly
driven the time when Mr Bingley s name had been the
between them and if judge complexion
mind was not differently

There is in the after
pause you you
me or do much introduce my your
your Lambton

The surprise of such an was indeed it was
for her in manner acceded it felt
that desire of being acquainted with her
must the work of her brother and without looking farther it was
satisfactory it was that resentment had not
think ill of her

They now on in each of them deep in Elizabeth
was not that was impossible was flattered and
wish of introducing her was of
the They outstripped the and when they had
the carriage Mr and Mrs Gardiner were half quarter of
mile

then asked her into the declared not
tired and they together on the lawn such time much
been said and was wanted talk
there an embargo on every subject
that had been and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with Yet time and her aunt and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn before the was
over On Mr and Mrs Gardiner s they were
into the and take refreshment was and
they parted on each side with politeness Mr handed the
ladies into the carriage and when it drove Elizabeth saw
walking the

The observations of her uncle and aunt now and each of them
pronounced infinitely anything they had expected
is polite and unassuming said her uncle

There is little in sure her
aunt it is confined air and is not unbecoming can now
say with the that though people may call proud
seen of it

was never than It was
than civil it was attentive and there was no for such
with Elizabeth was

sure Lizzy said her aunt is not so handsome as
or has not s countenance for features
good how came you tell me that was so
disagreeable

Elizabeth as as said that had
better when they had met in Kent than before and that had never
seen so as morning

may little whimsical in civilities
her uncle Your men and therefore not take
word as change mind another and warn me


Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood character
said

we seen of Mrs Gardiner
not that in so way
anybody as has poor has not an ill natured look
On the there is mouth when
speaks And there is of in countenance that would
not give an unfavourable of sure the
good lady showed did give flaming character
hardly aloud is liberal
master suppose and that in the of servant comprehends every
virtue

Elizabeth here felt called on say in vindication of
and therefore gave them understand in
as guarded manner as that had heard
in Kent actions were capable of different
construction and that character was no means so faulty nor
s so as they had been considered in Hertfordshire In
of the of the pecuniary
transactions in they had been without naming
her it such as relied on

Mrs Gardiner was and as they were now
the of her former every gave way
the of and was much in
her husband the interesting spots in environs think of
anything Fatigued as had been the morning s they
had no sooner dined than again in of her former
and the was in the satisfactions of
intercourse after many years discontinuance

The of the were of interest leave Elizabeth
much for any of these new and do
think and think with wonder of Mr s and above
of wishing her acquainted with



Chapter 44


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr would visit
her the after her reaching Pemberley and was consequently
not of sight of the inn the of that morning
her was for on the morning after their
arrival Lambton these visitors came They had been walking the
place with of their new and were just the inn
for dining with the same when the sound of
carriage drew them window and they saw gentleman and lady in
curricle driving the street Elizabeth recognizing
the livery guessed it and imparted no of her
surprise her acquainting them with the honour
expected Her uncle and aunt were amazement and the
of her manner as spoke the and many
of the circumstances of the preceding opened them new on
the business had ever it before they felt that
there was no way of accounting for such such
quarter than supposing partiality for their these
newly born notions were in their heads the perturbation of
Elizabeth s feelings was every increasing was quite
amazed her discomposure amongst of disquiet
dreaded the partiality of the brother said much
in her favour and than commonly
suspected that every of would fail her

retreated the window of being seen and as
and down the room endeavouring saw such of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as everything

and her brother appeared and formidable
took place With did Elizabeth that her new
was as much as her
being Lambton had heard that was proud
the observation of her that was
only shy it obtain even word
her monosyllable

was tall and on scale than Elizabeth and though
little than sixteen her figure was formed and her
womanly and graceful was handsome than her brother there
was sense and good humour in her and her were
unassuming and Elizabeth had expected in her as
acute and unembarrassed an as ever Mr had been was much
discerning such different feelings

They had not been together before Mr told her that Bingley
was wait on her and had barely time her
satisfaction and for such visitor when Bingley s quick
was heard on the and in entered the room
Elizabeth s anger against had been away had still
felt any it hardly ground against the unaffected
with on her again
in though way after her and
and spoke with the same good ease that had ever

Mr and Mrs Gardiner was interesting personage
than They had The before
them indeed lively The suspicions had just
arisen of Mr and their their observation
each with an earnest though guarded and they drew
those the that of them knew
it was Of the lady s they remained little
in that the gentleman was overflowing with was
enough

Elizabeth on her side had much do wanted ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors wanted her and
make and in the latter object where
fail was sure of for those
endeavoured give were prepossessed in her favour Bingley
was was eager and

In Bingley her thoughts flew her and oh
how did any of were in
manner that talked than on
former and or twice with the
that as her was trying trace resemblance
though not deceived as
had been as rival Jane No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard
between them that justify the of On
was satisfied and or three little circumstances
ere they parted in her interpretation denoted
of Jane not untinctured and wish of saying
that the of her had
her when the were talking together and in tone
had of real regret that it was time
had had the of her and before reply
It is above eight months We not met the 26th of
when we were together

Elizabeth was memory so exact and afterwards
took occasion her when unattended any of the
her were Longbourn There was not much in the
nor in the preceding there was look and manner
gave them

It was not that turn her eyes on Mr
whenever did catch saw an expression of
and in that said heard an accent so removed
or disdain of companions as her that
the improvement of had however
temporary prove had outlived When
saw the and courting the good
of people with any intercourse months ago would been
disgrace when saw civil not only the
had and their
lively in Hunsford the the change was
so and struck so forcibly on her mind that hardly
restrain her being Never even in the
of dear or dignified
had seen so desirous so free
or unbending reserve as now when no
result the of and when even the
of those were would
down the ridicule and of the ladies of and


Their visitors with them above half an and when they
Mr called on join in expressing
their wish of Mr and Mrs Gardiner and Bennet dinner
Pemberley before they left the country though with
diffidence marked her little in the habit of invitations
Mrs Gardiner her desirous of
how the felt disposed as
Elizabeth had turned away her head Presuming however
that studied avoidance spoke than
any of the proposal and in her husband was of
willingness it ventured for
her and the after the was on

Bingley in the of Elizabeth
again still deal say her and many
make after their Hertfordshire Elizabeth construing
into wish of hearing her speak of her was and on
as as when their
visitors left them capable of considering the half with
satisfaction though it was the enjoyment of it had been
little Eager alone and of or her
uncle and aunt with them only enough hear their
of Bingley and then hurried away

had no fear Mr and Mrs Gardiner s curiosity it was
not their wish force her communication It was that was
much better acquainted with Mr than they had before any of
it was that was much in with her They saw much
interest justify

Of Mr it was now matter of anxiety think and as
as their there was no fault They
not untouched politeness and had they drawn character
their feelings and servant s report without any reference
any the in Hertfordshire was
would not recognized it for Mr There was now an interest
however in believing the and they sensible
that the of servant had was four
years old and whose indicated respectability was not
hastily rejected had anything in the of
their Lambton that lessen They had
of pride pride had and if not
it would certainly imputed the inhabitants of market
where the did not visit It was acknowledged however that
was liberal man and did much good among the poor

With the that was not
there in much for though the of with the
son of were imperfectly it was yet
that on quitting Derbyshire had left many debts
Mr afterwards discharged

As for Elizabeth her thoughts were Pemberley than
the and the though as it it was not
enough her feelings in that mansion
and lay endeavouring make them
certainly did not hate No hatred had vanished ago and
had as been of ever feeling against
that so called The created the of
valuable qualities though first had for
time ceased repugnant her feeling and it was now heightened
into somewhat of friendlier nature the testimony so highly in
favour and bringing in so
had above above and
there was her of not
It was gratitude gratitude not merely for her

On reaching the they were the hall into the saloon

trying talk the latter had they not been seated an
inconvenient distance was not sorry spared the
of saying much Her thoughts were employing her expected every

given remind her of her post There was now for the
for though they not talk they eat and the
pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches collected
them round the

Elizabeth had fair opportunity of deciding

feelings on entering the room and then though

gentlemen the was the river and had left
only on learning that the ladies of the intended visit

and that there was an did not watch
when first came into the room In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Bingley s in spite of the
smiles overspread her whenever spoke of
objects for jealousy had not yet her desperate and her
Mr were no means over on her brother s

as much as possible every attempt on either side

instantly comprehended that was uppermost in her thoughts and the
recollections with gave her s

for the welfare of friend

Elizabeth s collected however quieted emotion and
as Bingley vexed and disappointed not approach

her interest in the affair and the
had been designed turn thoughts Elizabeth
them on her and cheerfully

Their visit did not after the and answer above

Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth s

If gratitude and good foundations of affection Elizabeth s

been thinking it over again Elizabeth said her uncle as they
drove the and serious am much
than was judge as your eldest on the
matter It appears me so that any man
form such against girl is no means unprotected or
friendless and was staying in s that
am strongly hope the best that her
would not again the
after such an affront temptation is
not adequate the

Do you think so Elizabeth brightening for

my word said Mrs Gardiner begin of your uncle s
It is violation of decency honour and
interest for guilty of cannot think so ill of
Can you yourself Lizzy so give as
capable of it

Not of interest of every
neglect can capable If indeed it so
dare not hope it they not on Scotland if that had been
the

In the first place Mr Gardiner there is no absolute
that they not gone Scotland

Oh their removing the into hackney coach is such
presumption And besides no traces of them were on the
Barnet road

then supposing them in London They may there though
for the of concealment for no exceptional It is
not likely that abundant on either side and it
strike them that they economically though
expeditiously in London than in Scotland

secrecy any fear of detection must their
Oh no no is not likely particular
friend you Jane s was of never
her never without
cannot it And claims has attraction has
and good humour that make for her sake
forego every of benefiting marrying As
the apprehensions of disgrace in the throw on
dishonourable elopement with her am not judge for
of the effects that such produce as your
objection am it hardly hold good has
no brothers and my father s
indolence and the little has ever
give was going in that would
do as little and think as little it as any father do in
such matter

can you think that is so everything of
as consent live with on any terms than

It seem and it is shocking indeed Elizabeth with
tears in her eyes that s sense of decency and virtue in such
of not say
am not her is has never
been taught think on serious subjects and for the half year
for twelvemonth has been given
and vanity has been allowed dispose of her time in the idle
and frivolous manner and adopt any opinions that came in her way
the were first quartered in
flirtation and been in her head has been
everything in her thinking and talking on the subject give
call it susceptibility her feelings
lively enough And we that has every of
and address that can captivate

you that Jane said her aunt not think so ill of
as capable of the attempt

Of Jane ever think ill And is there
their former conduct that would think capable of such an attempt
till it were proved against them Jane as as do
is We that has been profligate in every
sense of the word that has nor honour that is
as and deceitful as is insinuating

And do you Mrs Gardiner whose curiosity
as the of her was alive

do indeed Elizabeth told you the
of Mr and you yourself when
Longbourn heard in manner spoke of the man had
with such and liberality And there
circumstances am not liberty it is not worth
lies the Pemberley endless
said of was thoroughly proud
disagreeable girl Yet knew the
must that was as and unpretending as we
her

of can ignorant of you
and Jane seem so understand

Oh yes that that is the of Till was in Kent and saw
so much of Mr and was
ignorant of the myself And when the
was leave in week or fortnight s time As that was the
Jane the nor it
make public for of use
it apparently any that the good the
neighbourhood had of then overthrown And even when it was
settled that with Mrs the of opening
her eyes character never me That
in any the deception never entered my head That such
as ensue you may was
enough my thoughts

When they removed Brighton therefore you had no
suppose them of each

Not the slightest can remember no symptom of affection on either
side and had anything of the been perceptible you must aware
that ours is not on it away When first
entered the was enough so we
were Every girl in or near was of her for
the first months never her any particular
and consequently after moderate period of extravagant and
her for gave way and of the
her with distinction again her favourites



It may believed that however little of
their and conjectures on interesting subject
discussion no detain them it
the of the journey Elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent
there the of anguish
no interval of ease or forgetfulness

They travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping night
on the road Longbourn dinner time the It was
Elizabeth consider that Jane not been wearied
expectations

The little attracted the sight of were
on the steps of the as they entered the paddock and when the
carriage drove the the joyful surprise that lighted their
faces and displayed over their bodies in of
capers and frisks was the first earnest of their welcome

Elizabeth jumped and after each of them hasty kiss
hurried into the where Jane came running down her
mother s met her

Elizabeth as embraced her tears filled the
eyes of not in asking anything had been
heard of the fugitives

Not yet Jane now that my dear uncle is come hope
everything

Is my father in

Yes went on as you word

And you heard

We heard only twice me on Wednesday say
that had arrived in safety and give me

Her however assured her of her being and their

of the Jane her uncle and aunt and welcomed and
them with alternate smiles and tears

When they were in the room the Elizabeth
had already asked were of the and they
that Jane had no give The sanguine hope of
good however the of her had not yet
deserted her still expected that it would end and that
every morning would letter either or her father
explain their proceedings and announce their

Mrs Bennet whose they after
together received them as expected with
tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous
conduct of and complaints of her sufferings and ill
everybody the whose ill judging the
errors of her daughter must owing

If had been said carry my in going Brighton

had nobody take care of her did the Forsters ever her
of their sight am sure there was neglect or on their
side for is not the of girl do such thing if had been
after always they were unfit the
charge of her was overruled as always am Poor dear child
And now here s Mr Bennet gone away and fight
wherever meets and then killed and is
of The Collinses turn before is cold in
and if you not brother do not we
do

They against such terrific ideas and Mr Gardiner after
of affection for her and her told her
that in London the and would assist Mr
Bennet in every for recovering

Do not give way though it is right
for the there is no occasion look on it as certain
It is not quite week they left Brighton In days we
may news of them and till we that they not
and no of marrying do not give the matter over as
As as get my brother and make
come with me Street and then we may
together as is

Oh my dear brother Mrs Bennet that is
wish for And now do when you get them
wherever they may and if they not already make them
And as for clothes do not them wait for that
tell as much as chooses them
after they And above Mr Bennet fighting
Tell state am in that am frighted of my
wits and such tremblings such flutterings over me such
spasms in my side and in my head and such beatings that
can get no night nor And tell my dear not
give any her clothes till has seen me for
not the best Oh brother how you
you contrive it

Mr Gardiner though assured her again of earnest
in the cause not recommending moderation her as
in her as her fear and after talking with her in manner till
dinner was on the they left her her feelings on
the attended in the of her

Though her brother and were that there was no real
occasion for such seclusion the they did not attempt
oppose it for they knew that had not enough hold her
before the they waited and judged it
better that only of the household and the they
trust comprehend her and solicitude on the

In the dining room they were Mary and had been
busily in their separate apartments make their

faces of however were tolerably and no change was
in either except that the of her or the anger

involves her in endless that her reputation is no
brittle than it is and that cannot much guarded in
her the undeserving of the

Elizabeth lifted her eyes in amazement was much oppressed
make any reply Mary however with such
of moral extractions the evil before them

In the afternoon the Bennets were for
half an and Elizabeth instantly availed of
the opportunity of making any Jane was eager

paler than sedate than Elizabeth had expected On the
gentlemen s appearing her yet received them with
tolerable ease and with of free any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary

Elizabeth said as little either as would and sat down

not an conjecture

Bingley had seen for an and in that period

her curtsey and address friend

Elizabeth knew that her mother the latter

Mr Bennet them supper voice and manner showed
how happy was

Not word however in it till their
visitor took leave for the night as as was gone

In revolving Lady s however not

of warmest affection and secure of her

much better than expected for Mrs Bennet
in such awe of her intended son in law that ventured not speak

her husband bore it however with admirable even
listen Lucas when on carrying away
the jewel of the country and of their
St James s with decent If did
shrug shoulders it was not till was of sight

Mrs Phillips s vulgarity was another and on
and though Mrs Phillips as as her in
much awe of speak with the familiarity Bingley s good
humour yet whenever did speak must vulgar
Nor was her for though it her quiet
likely make her elegant Elizabeth did shield
the frequent notice of either and was ever

afterwards Mrs Bingley and talked of Mrs may
guessed wish say for the sake of her that the
of her earnest desire in the of so many
of her so happy an as make her sensible
informed for the of her life though it
was for her husband not relished
in so unusual form that still was and
silly

Mr Bennet missed second daughter affection for her
drew oftener than anything do delighted in
going Pemberley especially when was expected

Mr Bingley and Jane remained only twelvemonth So near
vicinity her mother and was not desirable even
easy temper or her The darling wish of
was then gratified bought an estate in neighbouring county
Derbyshire and Jane and Elizabeth in every

temper as and removed the of s example
and management irritable
ignorant and insipid the disadvantage of s
was of kept and though Mrs
her come and with her with the of
and men her father would never consent her going

Mary was the only daughter remained and was necessarily
drawn the pursuit of accomplishments Mrs Bennet s being quite
unable alone Mary was obliged mix with the world
still moralize over every morning visit and as was no
longer mortified comparisons between her beauty and her
it was suspected her father that submitted the change without
much reluctance

As for and their suffered no revolution
the of her bore with philosophy the that
Elizabeth must now acquainted with of ingratitude
and had before been her and in spite of every
thing was not without hope that yet on
make fortune The congratulatory letter Elizabeth received
on her explained her that
if not such hope was cherished The letter was


MY DEAR LIZZY

you must happy It is you so
and when you do hope you think of

think we quite enough live without
Any place would do of three or four year however
do not speak Mr it if you had not

Yours etc

As it that Elizabeth had much not endeavoured in
her answer an end every entreaty and expectation of the
Such relief however as it was in her the
of called economy in her expences
them It had always been her that such an
as theirs under the direction of persons so extravagant in
their and heedless of the future must
their support and whenever they changed their either Jane or
were sure of being applied for little assistance
discharging their bills Their manner of living even when the
of peace dismissed them was unsettled in the
extreme They were always place place in of cheap
situation and always than they affection for
her into hers lasted little longer and
in spite of her and her retained the claims
reputation her had given her

Though never Pemberley yet for
Elizabeth s sake in profession was

in London or Bath and with the they of them
staid so that even Bingley s good humour was overcome and
proceeded so as talk of them hint gone

Bingley was mortified s as

attentive as heretofore and paid every arrear of
Elizabeth

Pemberley was now s and the of the
